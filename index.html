												<h3>Satellite Positioning</h3>
												<p>My love for GNSS and satellite positioning stems from a deep fascination with how invisible signals from space can precisely determine locations on Earth. This technology has transformed the field of Geomatics Engineering, offering powerful tools that bring accuracy, efficiency, and reliability to spatial data collection.</p>

												<h3>Remote Sensing and GIS</h3>
												<p>My passion for GIS (Geographic Information Systems) and Remote Sensing comes from their power to transform complex spatial data into meaningful insights. These technologies allow us to visualize, analyze, and understand the Earth in ways that were once unimaginable — all from a digital workspace or a satellite’s perspective.</p>

												<h3>Programming</h3>
												<p>My journey into programming began with curiosity — but it quickly evolved into a powerful toolset that compliments my passion for geomatics. Among all languages, Python stands out for its simplicity, versatility, and robust ecosystem, making it a go-to choice for spatial analysis and GNSS data processing. Python bridges the gap between raw geospatial data and meaningful insights. From building custom map applications to automating GNSS workflows, Python empowers geomatics engineers to push the limits of spatial intelligence.</p>

												<h3>Entrepreneurship</h3>
												<p>I learned the spirit of entrepreneurship from my mum — a resilient, hardworking woman who taught me the value of perseverance, community, and turning challenges into opportunities. With her guidance and support, I started my very first venture: selling palm oil. That experience gave me hands-on insight into the basics of business — managing supply, building trust with customers, and learning how to adapt and grow. Since then, my entrepreneurial mindset has only expanded. Today, I’m working on several exciting ideas that combine my passion for technology, community, and innovation: <li><a href="#" >Edwomu, </a><a href="#" >Me Kurom, </a><a href="#" >The Geosurvey Tech</a></li></p>

											<h3>Akokoaso Base Map</h3>

											<p>Akokoaso is a town located in the Akyemansa District in the Eastern Region of Ghana. It is a part of the traditional Akyem states, which are historically significant and known for their rich culture and heritage. Akokoaso, like many towns in the district, is a rural community with agriculture being the primary occupation of its people.</p>

											<h3>Visual Alberta Land Cover</h3>
											<p>Visualise the Alberta land cover from the ESA at a 10m resolution. This dataset was streamed from google earth. Currently I am still working on the percentage or area of the various landsize of the covers. I would also update this in the meantime. The datasets used were available as the time of 2020-01-01T00:00:00Z–2021-01-01T00:00:00Z from google earth engine. I am also working on getting the legend on the html file.</p>
